abstract: 'Automated fact-checking systems increasingly rely on retrieval-augmented large language models to verify claims against external evidence. However, these systems often encounter conflicting evidence from different sources, posing significant challenges for accurate verdict prediction. In this work, we investigate how retrieval-augmented LLMs handle conflicting evidence during fact-checking. We propose a novel framework that explicitly models evidence conflicts and employs multi-perspective reasoning to reconcile contradictory information. Our approach incorporates source credibility assessment, temporal context analysis, and claim decomposition to systematically resolve conflicts. Through extensive experiments on multiple fact-checking benchmarks, we demonstrate that our method significantly improves accuracy in scenarios with conflicting evidence, achieving state-of-the-art performance while providing interpretable explanations for the verification decisions.'
