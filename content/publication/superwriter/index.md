abstract: 'We introduce SuperWriter, a novel framework that leverages reflection mechanisms to enable large language models to generate high-quality long-form content. Traditional LLMs often struggle with maintaining coherence and consistency across extended text. SuperWriter addresses this challenge through an iterative reflection-driven approach that continuously evaluates and refines the generated content. The framework incorporates self-critique, structural planning, and coherence verification at multiple granularities. Experimental results demonstrate that SuperWriter significantly outperforms baseline approaches on various long-form writing tasks, including article generation, story writing, and technical documentation, while maintaining factual accuracy and narrative flow throughout the generated text.'
