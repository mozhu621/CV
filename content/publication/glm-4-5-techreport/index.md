abstract: 'This technical report presents GLM-4.5, a new generation of foundation models designed for agentic capabilities, advanced reasoning, and code generation. GLM-4.5 features enhanced long-context understanding up to 1M tokens, improved instruction following, and state-of-the-art performance on complex reasoning tasks. We detail the model architecture, training methodology including multi-stage alignment techniques, and comprehensive evaluation results across diverse benchmarks. Special emphasis is placed on long-form generation capabilities and reinforcement learning from human feedback.'
