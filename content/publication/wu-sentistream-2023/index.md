abstract: 'Real-world sentiment analysis faces the challenge of evolving data distributions and concept drift in streaming scenarios. We present SentiStream, a novel co-training framework that adapts to changing sentiment patterns in online data streams without requiring continuous labeled data. By leveraging complementary views and confidence-based sample selection, our approach maintains high accuracy while adapting to distribution shifts. Extensive experiments on Twitter and product review streams demonstrate SentiStream effectiveness in handling concept drift, achieving superior performance compared to existing online learning methods while significantly reducing annotation requirements.'
