I am a third-year PhD student at the Singapore University of Technology and Design advised by Prof. [Roy Ka-Wei Lee](https://info.roylee.sg/). My research centers on the long-form generation and long-context capabilities of LLMs, spanning hierarchical data generation, chain-of-thought and planning, RL-based training and alignment, and end-to-end evaluation and benchmarking for long text, code, and reasoning.
